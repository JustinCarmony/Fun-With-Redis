*********************************************************

PHP Binding for Rackspace Cloud APIs, originally developed for Cloud Servers but
being extended to add support for Cloud Load Balancers, Cloud DNS and Cloud
Files.

*Usage*

Include Cloud.php in your project, and call the constructor for the service you
require. e.g. for Cloud Servers:

    DEFINE('API_ID', '');
    DEFINE('API_KEY', '');

    $cloud = new Cloud_Server(API_ID, API_KEY);

By default this will create a connection to the US API, to use the UK API add
the location variable "UK" to the end of the constructor, e.g.:

    $cloud = new Cloud_Server(API_ID, API_KEY, "UK");

Cloud Load Balancers operate in the same way and have an additional optional
variable for the datacentre that contains the Load Balancers, defaulting to
"ORD" (Chicago).  To create a connection to the DFW datacentre:

    $cloud = new Cloud_LoadBalancer(API_ID, API_Key, "US", "DFW");
